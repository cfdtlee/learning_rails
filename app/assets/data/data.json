Keep pouring out yourself to help others so that God can keep filling you up with His spirit.  The more you give, the more you will have for yourself.

As they talked about old times in Joe\u2019s living room, Joe noticed that his old buddy  seemed melancholy, and finally Joe asked what was wrong?  His friend finally admitted that his life had been going downhill for years, that he couldn\u2019t stop drinking, that he was nearly penniless and couldn\u2019t figure out a solution.  Joe\u2019s friend looked so thin, Joe offered to go into the kitchen and make him something to eat. Joe\u2019s friend declined saying he had a big lunch. Half wanting to make conversation and half wanting to make sure he had eaten,  Joe asked his old friend what he had for lunch.  The friend replied \u201cOh the same old thing ... bologna sandwich ... I hate bologna and I\u2019ve had it for lunch every day for the past twenty years.\u201d  Joe replied \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just ask your wife to make you something else?\u201d.

He found another and, together, they stayed sober for each other.I\u2019ve worked with recovering addicts for twenty six years, and I\u2019ve noticed that those who stay and reap the rewards of sobriety, are those who try the hardest to help others recover from addiction.  Although the best reason to stay clean and sober is for oneself, I believe that the addict who stays sober is also motivated by knowing that staying sober will help someone else.   \u201c Keep yourself like an empty vessel for God to fill.  Keep pouring out yourself to help others so that God can keep filling you up with His spirit.  The more you give, the more you will have for yourself.  God will see that you are kept filled as long as you are giving to others.

We make a big deal about this in therapy and for good cause. How one is doing is very important to one\u2019s sobriety. Recovering alcoholics need each other to stay sober, and waiting for a response to the \u201cHow are you?\u201d inquiry is critical.Similarly, recovering people should not respond to a \u201cHow are you?\u201d question with the word \u201cFine.\u201d \u201cFine\u201d is too often merely a cover up for fear of expressing what is commonly deemed socially unacceptable feelings.  The acronym given to FINE is F--ked up, Insane, Neurotic and Excited.    In her classic book, \u201cPeoplemaking,\u201d Virginia Satir states:If a person feels bad and he\u2019s asked how he feels, he will answer, \u201cFine,\u201d because...he probably concludes, no one is really interested anyway, so why not pick the expected answer?\u201d P.51.Now I am not arguing here that we need to make too big a deal of a simple \u201cHow are ya\u2019\u201d in our everyday affairs.

If you find you are constantly telling your son to hang up his clothes, take out the trash, clean the tables, etc. you will be amazed how your teenager will respond when you just ask him \u201cHow Ya Doin\u2019?\u201d  The same is true for your wife of twenty years.

The beginning of understanding may actually involve your apology and willingness to make amends. There was a hit movie in the 1970's starring Ryan O\u2019Neil and Allie McGraw, that many deem a classic, called \u201cLove Story.\u201d   It was a romance between a poor girl and a rich boy.  At one point, the poor girl says, \u201cDon\u2019t you know Ollie,...  Love means you never have to say you\u2019re sorry.\u201d  That quote was often repeated by young married couples - as the divorce rate escalated.  The truth is that anyone who uses that quote is doomed to make the other person feel worse.  This is true for two fundamental reasons: first, it assumes that the person refusing to say he or she is sorry is perfect, and we all know that perfect people only exist in the movies.  Second, the above quote encourages partners (and adversaries) to stifle verbal communication and to take the other person\u2019s feelings for granted.  Often relationship breakdown occurs because we expect perfection from others even though we know that we all have subjective points of view and we all make mistakes. These mistakes cause wars, divorce, hurt feelings and negotiation breakdown.  So the first step in trying to understand others is to remember that the other person is imperfect and incapable of behaving in exactly the way that you expect him or her to behave. To improve relationships, search for the point during the relationship where we hurt the other person\u2019s feelings, remembering that we can injure feelings even when we were absolutely justified in what we said or did.  It is important to focus on what we may have done , rather than merely trying to prove the other person wrong. Proving someone wrong makes them feel bad.  The sad truth is the overwhelming majority of people are just not wise and callous enough to accept being proved wrong, and they may hold this bad feeling against you.  Often we do the most damage to a relationship when we believe we are right or when we feel most justified in what we say or do. Righteousness and justification can work hell on interpersonal relationships. Righteousness and justification are frequently the stuff of our real enemy, the ego. When you take your inventory, you may find that righteousness and justification may be causing you resentments and are character defects that you may want to humbly ask your Higher Power to remove.  If this is the case, you may conclude that you need to make amends to the person  whose feelings you wish to heal and say something like \u201cwhen I said that you were  wrong and then I insisted that such and such was the only way, well, I am sorry I said that.  I was insensitive and I\u2019m sorry.  Furthermore, I will try to change.\u201d Even if the other person does not immediately forgive you - even if you are mistaken as to whether you apologized about something that in fact hurt the other person\u2019s feelings - you\u2019ll make the other person feel better because the other person will know that you care enough about him or her to say you\u2019re sorry.

A friend was doing well with \"happy\" and \"free\" but struggling with \"joy\" until his Sponsor asked him, \"What is the first thing that comes to your mind that you are grateful for and did not create?\"  My friend replied, \"Well I woke up today, I didn't come to\" and spontaneously laughed with joy!", "identifier": 198, "todo": "To Do: Keep a grateful heart to feel the joy that obliterates nervousness, sadness, and fear.", "title": "Joy is gratitude for something you didnt create"}, {"message": "\"Let me take life as it comes, not as I would have it be.\"<br><br>\"The computer won't work.

I consequently tend to stuff too much into one day.  I tend to create artificial deadlines.  I fear that if I don\u2019t get everything done today, it\u2019ll pile up and then I\u2019ll be \u201cunder the gun.\u201d   So, I make the mistake of creating an emergency due to my fear of putting myself under the gun later.  This occurs because I am overly conscious of the negative consequences of procrastination.Solution to problem 2: Regarding my fear that if I don\u2019t do it now, it will never get done is also a bunch of hooey!  If it doesn\u2019t get done today, tomorrow or the next day, then it\u2019s because I either had something more remunerative to be done or I\u2019m dead in which case it won\u2019t matter.  I must also note that I used the word \u201cFEAR\u201d in stating my problem.  Anytime I use that word, I\u2019ve got to wonder if this is a \u201cboogie man\u201d I\u2019m creating or whether I really have anything to fear.  In recovery, the acronym for fear is False Evidence Appearing Real. Fear is illusory.  I must therefore ask myself, \u201cWhat am I afraid of?\u201d Again, prioritizing is the key to dealing with my fear of not getting everything done.Solution to problem 3: To schedule more time between meetings, I need to take into account human functions like driving time, running into somebody who may need a kind word, or even helping someone who may have a real emergency. I\u2019ve got to remember that red lights happen too.  They weren\u2019t just put there to make me angry and impede my way.  Everybody has to stop for them.  The bigger picture, of course, is we all have a right to move along with our lives and sometimes that means it is my turn to wait. Scheduling \u201cin between time\u201d gives me more time to make others feel better.  I\u2019ve found that if I take a few minutes to \u201cstop and smell\u201d the roses, my mind relaxes.By living in the above simple solutions, I have eased a lot of the emergencies out of my life, and I have continued to be more productive too.  I\u2019m easier on myself, and I achieve my goal more often because I\u2019m easier on others.

We can then be pleasantly surprised when we perform well.Lowering one\u2019s expectations does not require lowering one\u2019s optimism. We should always be encouraging and hopeful that we and others will try their best; we should always approach challenges with confidence. However, we must also bear in mind that none of us are perfect, and that successful results are never guaranteed. By lowering our expectations, we become less dependent on others (and external circumstances beyond our control) controlling our serenity.Now, let\u2019s take the same scenario with lower expectations.

I tell myself I am as imperfect as anyone else so why not give myself a break.

It means that you should try to be comfortable when life throws its little nuisances at you.  Don\u2019t allow the world to close in on you and choke you.  Make a conscious effort to accept life and not resist life because if you resist, problems persist.  Everybody, regardless of wealth and health, has daily problems.  Don\u2019t turn problems into drama.  Don\u2019t turn comedy into tragedy.  An exercise I do now on an almost daily basis is to become aware when I am getting upset because I am not getting my way.  One thing I do is to make believe I am in a movie.  I try to imagine how the audience would be responding to my predicament.  Nine times out of ten, the audience would be laughing. They would not be laughing sadistically, but they would be laughing because my predicament is truly funny.  My predicament is a comedy because most of my predicaments are not permanently harmful to me.  Sure they may cost me some time,  money or ego gratification, but ultimately most of my dramas are truly funny, and I can only see their humor once I am able to put myself in the audience.  Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying.  Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55.  My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not \u201cfor that 20 year old\u201d linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.

Each of the three held boxes that no doubt were going to require lengthy attention once the clerks were freed from their current interminable chores.  I began to feel the familiar heart pounding that I experience when I am forced to wait in line.  I considered my options.

I closed my eyes and asked my Higher Power to calm me, but my heart continued to race.  I  noticed a woman standing behind me.

Each of the three held boxes that no doubt were going to require lengthy attention once the clerks were freed from their current interminable chores.

I took a chance and told her, \u201cYou know, my biggest weakness is waiting.

I fear that if I don\u2019t get everything done today, it\u2019ll pile up and then I\u2019ll be \u201cunder the gun.\u201d   So, I make the mistake of creating an emergency due to my fear of putting myself under the gun later.  This occurs because I am overly conscious of the negative consequences of procrastination.Solution to problem 2: Regarding my fear that if I don\u2019t do it now, it will never get done is also a bunch of hooey!  If it doesn\u2019t get done today, tomorrow or the next day, then it\u2019s because I either had something more remunerative to be done or I\u2019m dead in which case it won\u2019t matter.  I must also note that I used the word \u201cFEAR\u201d in stating my problem.  Anytime I use that word, I\u2019ve got to wonder if this is a \u201cboogie man\u201d I\u2019m creating or whether I really have anything to fear.  In recovery, the acronym for fear is False Evidence Appearing Real. Fear is illusory.  I must therefore ask myself, \u201cWhat am I afraid of?\u201d Again, prioritizing is the key to dealing with my fear of not getting everything done.Solution to problem 3: To schedule more time between meetings, I need to take into account human functions like driving time, running into somebody who may need a kind word, or even helping someone who may have a real emergency. I\u2019ve got to remember that red lights happen too.  They weren\u2019t just put there to make me angry and impede my way.  Everybody has to stop for them.  The bigger picture, of course, is we all have a right to move along with our lives and sometimes that means it is my turn to wait. Scheduling \u201cin between time\u201d gives me more time to make others feel better.  I\u2019ve found that if I take a few minutes to \u201cstop and smell\u201d the roses, my mind relaxes.By living in the above simple solutions, I have eased a lot of the emergencies out of my life, and I have continued to be more productive too.

Although the best reason to stay clean and sober is for oneself, I believe that the addict who stays sober is also motivated by knowing that staying sober will help someone else.   \u201c Keep yourself like an empty vessel for God to fill.  Keep pouring out yourself to help others so that God can keep filling you up with His spirit.  The more you give, the more you will have for yourself.

They would not be laughing sadistically, but they would be laughing because my predicament is truly funny.  My predicament is a comedy because most of my predicaments are not permanently harmful to me.

Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying.  Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55.  My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not \u201cfor that 20 year old\u201d linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.

They would not be laughing sadistically, but they would be laughing because my predicament is truly funny.  My predicament is a comedy because most of my predicaments are not permanently harmful to me.  Sure they may cost me some time,  money or ego gratification, but ultimately most of my dramas are truly funny, and I can only see their humor once I am able to put myself in the audience.  Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying.  Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55.  My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not \u201cfor that 20 year old\u201d linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.

When you are trying to understand rather than be understood, you are pushing yourself further away from a relapse. The beginning of understanding may actually involve your apology and willingness to make amends. There was a hit movie in the 1970's starring Ryan O\u2019Neil and Allie McGraw, that many deem a classic, called \u201cLove Story.\u201d   It was a romance between a poor girl and a rich boy.  At one point, the poor girl says, \u201cDon\u2019t you know Ollie,...  Love means you never have to say you\u2019re sorry.\u201d  That quote was often repeated by young married couples - as the divorce rate escalated.  The truth is that anyone who uses that quote is doomed to make the other person feel worse.  This is true for two fundamental reasons: first, it assumes that the person refusing to say he or she is sorry is perfect, and we all know that perfect people only exist in the movies.  Second, the above quote encourages partners (and adversaries) to stifle verbal communication and to take the other person\u2019s feelings for granted.  Often relationship breakdown occurs because we expect perfection from others even though we know that we all have subjective points of view and we all make mistakes. These mistakes cause wars, divorce, hurt feelings and negotiation breakdown.  So the first step in trying to understand others is to remember that the other person is imperfect and incapable of behaving in exactly the way that you expect him or her to behave. To improve relationships, search for the point during the relationship where we hurt the other person\u2019s feelings, remembering that we can injure feelings even when we were absolutely justified in what we said or did.  It is important to focus on what we may have done , rather than merely trying to prove the other person wrong. Proving someone wrong makes them feel bad.  The sad truth is the overwhelming majority of people are just not wise and callous enough to accept being proved wrong, and they may hold this bad feeling against you.  Often we do the most damage to a relationship when we believe we are right or when we feel most justified in what we say or do. Righteousness and justification can work hell on interpersonal relationships. Righteousness and justification are frequently the stuff of our real enemy, the ego. When you take your inventory, you may find that righteousness and justification may be causing you resentments and are character defects that you may want to humbly ask your Higher Power to remove.  If this is the case, you may conclude that you need to make amends to the person  whose feelings you wish to heal and say something like \u201cwhen I said that you were  wrong and then I insisted that such and such was the only way, well, I am sorry I said that.  I was insensitive and I\u2019m sorry.  Furthermore, I will try to change.\u201d Even if the other person does not immediately forgive you - even if you are mistaken as to whether you apologized about something that in fact hurt the other person\u2019s feelings - you\u2019ll make the other person feel better because the other person will know that you care enough about him or her to say you\u2019re sorry.

If it succeeds, then there, within him, is the beginning of learning.\u201d Soren  Kierkegaard.A client told me the following story which illustrates how fear of change keeps us where we don\u2019t want to be. Joe was meeting with an old friend who he hadn\u2019t seen for ten years. As they talked about old times in Joe\u2019s living room, Joe noticed that his old buddy  seemed melancholy, and finally Joe asked what was wrong?  His friend finally admitted that his life had been going downhill for years, that he couldn\u2019t stop drinking, that he was nearly penniless and couldn\u2019t figure out a solution.  Joe\u2019s friend looked so thin, Joe offered to go into the kitchen and make him something to eat. Joe\u2019s friend declined saying he had a big lunch. Half wanting to make conversation and half wanting to make sure he had eaten,  Joe asked his old friend what he had for lunch.  The friend replied \u201cOh the same old thing ... bologna sandwich ... I hate bologna and I\u2019ve had it for lunch every day for the past twenty years.\u201d  Joe replied \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just ask your wife to make you something else?\u201d.  The friend replied \u201cI\u2019m not married.\u201d The point is most of us would prefer to live the same old failures just because we are afraid to change.

The beginning of understanding may actually involve your apology and willingness to make amends. There was a hit movie in the 1970's starring Ryan O\u2019Neil and Allie McGraw, that many deem a classic, called \u201cLove Story.\u201d   It was a romance between a poor girl and a rich boy.  At one point, the poor girl says, \u201cDon\u2019t you know Ollie,...  Love means you never have to say you\u2019re sorry.\u201d  That quote was often repeated by young married couples - as the divorce rate escalated.  The truth is that anyone who uses that quote is doomed to make the other person feel worse.  This is true for two fundamental reasons: first, it assumes that the person refusing to say he or she is sorry is perfect, and we all know that perfect people only exist in the movies.  Second, the above quote encourages partners (and adversaries) to stifle verbal communication and to take the other person\u2019s feelings for granted.  Often relationship breakdown occurs because we expect perfection from others even though we know that we all have subjective points of view and we all make mistakes. These mistakes cause wars, divorce, hurt feelings and negotiation breakdown.  So the first step in trying to understand others is to remember that the other person is imperfect and incapable of behaving in exactly the way that you expect him or her to behave. To improve relationships, search for the point during the relationship where we hurt the other person\u2019s feelings, remembering that we can injure feelings even when we were absolutely justified in what we said or did.  It is important to focus on what we may have done , rather than merely trying to prove the other person wrong. Proving someone wrong makes them feel bad.  The sad truth is the overwhelming majority of people are just not wise and callous enough to accept being proved wrong, and they may hold this bad feeling against you.  Often we do the most damage to a relationship when we believe we are right or when we feel most justified in what we say or do. Righteousness and justification can work hell on interpersonal relationships. Righteousness and justification are frequently the stuff of our real enemy, the ego. When you take your inventory, you may find that righteousness and justification may be causing you resentments and are character defects that you may want to humbly ask your Higher Power to remove.  If this is the case, you may conclude that you need to make amends to the person  whose feelings you wish to heal and say something like \u201cwhen I said that you were  wrong and then I insisted that such and such was the only way, well, I am sorry I said that.  I was insensitive and I\u2019m sorry.  Furthermore, I will try to change.\u201d Even if the other person does not immediately forgive you - even if you are mistaken as to whether you apologized about something that in fact hurt the other person\u2019s feelings - you\u2019ll make the other person feel better because the other person will know that you care enough about him or her to say you\u2019re sorry.

One way to ruin our serenity and head for a relapse  is to have unrealistic expectations of ourselves and others.  High expectations cause stress.  Such stress may actually cause us to perform worse. It is far better to have lower expectations to minimize stress and disappointment. We can then be pleasantly surprised when we perform well. Lowering one\u2019s expectations does not require lowering one\u2019s optimism. We should always be encouraging and hopeful that we and others will try their best; we should always approach challenges with confidence. However, we must also bear in mind that none of us are perfect, and that successful results are never guaranteed. By lowering our expectations, we become less dependent on others (and external circumstances beyond our control) controlling our serenity.Now, let\u2019s take the same scenario with lower expectations.  Once again, the phone number isn\u2019t in the rolodex.   But this time, I didn\u2019t expect it to be in the first place I looked for it.  Rather, I started looking for the number knowing that I had been in a hurry on Friday afternoon to go home and see my son play baseball and that I had scribbled it somewhere close by and that if I took a minute and patiently looked for it now everything would be just fine and dandy.   I tell myself I am as imperfect as anyone else so why not give myself a break.

Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying.  Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55.  My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not \u201cfor that 20 year old\u201d linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.

One thing I do is to make believe I am in a movie.  I try to imagine how the audience would be responding to my predicament.  Nine times out of ten, the audience would be laughing. They would not be laughing sadistically, but they would be laughing because my predicament is truly funny.  My predicament is a comedy because most of my predicaments are not permanently harmful to me.  Sure they may cost me some time,  money or ego gratification, but ultimately most of my dramas are truly funny, and I can only see their humor once I am able to put myself in the audience.  Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying.  Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55.  My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not \u201cfor that 20 year old\u201d linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.

I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.

If it succeeds, then there, within him, is the beginning of learning.\u201d Soren  Kierkegaard.A client told me the following story which illustrates how fear of change keeps us where we don\u2019t want to be. Joe was meeting with an old friend who he hadn\u2019t seen for ten years. As they talked about old times in Joe\u2019s living room, Joe noticed that his old buddy  seemed melancholy, and finally Joe asked what was wrong?  His friend finally admitted that his life had been going downhill for years, that he couldn\u2019t stop drinking, that he was nearly penniless and couldn\u2019t figure out a solution.  Joe\u2019s friend looked so thin, Joe offered to go into the kitchen and make him something to eat. Joe\u2019s friend declined saying he had a big lunch. Half wanting to make conversation and half wanting to make sure he had eaten,  Joe asked his old friend what he had for lunch.  The friend replied \u201cOh the same old thing ... bologna sandwich ... I hate bologna and I\u2019ve had it for lunch every day for the past twenty years.\u201d  Joe replied \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just ask your wife to make you something else?\u201d.  The friend replied \u201cI\u2019m not married.\u201d The point is most of us would prefer to live the same old failures just because we are afraid to change.

First, admit that you are powerless to handle it alone. Then, turn the problem over to a Higher Power. That Higher Power may be a consultation with a sponsor, a therapist, or your God.  Maybe take an inventory and see where your own sensitivity may be contributing to the problem. If you can determine what the character sensitivity or issue is, tell someone else. If you can't determine what it is, discuss the situation with someone else. Try to find  your defect and not the defect in the person you think is causing the problem.

Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying.  Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55.  My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not \u201cfor that 20 year old\u201d linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.

We make a big deal about this in therapy and for good cause. How one is doing is very important to one\u2019s sobriety.

Never trust your first thought because it usually is wrong. Always test your first thought by thinking of its consequences (good and bad) and always think of possible alternative thoughts before you act.

The beginning of understanding may actually involve your apology and willingness to make amends. There was a hit movie in the 1970's starring Ryan O\u2019Neil and Allie McGraw, that many deem a classic, called \u201cLove Story.\u201d   It was a romance between a poor girl and a rich boy.  At one point, the poor girl says, \u201cDon\u2019t you know Ollie,...  Love means you never have to say you\u2019re sorry.\u201d  That quote was often repeated by young married couples - as the divorce rate escalated.  The truth is that anyone who uses that quote is doomed to make the other person feel worse.  This is true for two fundamental reasons: first, it assumes that the person refusing to say he or she is sorry is perfect, and we all know that perfect people only exist in the movies.  Second, the above quote encourages partners (and adversaries) to stifle verbal communication and to take the other person\u2019s feelings for granted.  Often relationship breakdown occurs because we expect perfection from others even though we know that we all have subjective points of view and we all make mistakes. These mistakes cause wars, divorce, hurt feelings and negotiation breakdown.  So the first step in trying to understand others is to remember that the other person is imperfect and incapable of behaving in exactly the way that you expect him or her to behave. To improve relationships, search for the point during the relationship where we hurt the other person\u2019s feelings, remembering that we can injure feelings even when we were absolutely justified in what we said or did.  It is important to focus on what we may have done , rather than merely trying to prove the other person wrong. Proving someone wrong makes them feel bad.  The sad truth is the overwhelming majority of people are just not wise and callous enough to accept being proved wrong, and they may hold this bad feeling against you.  Often we do the most damage to a relationship when we believe we are right or when we feel most justified in what we say or do. Righteousness and justification can work hell on interpersonal relationships. Righteousness and justification are frequently the stuff of our real enemy, the ego. When you take your inventory, you may find that righteousness and justification may be causing you resentments and are character defects that you may want to humbly ask your Higher Power to remove.  If this is the case, you may conclude that you need to make amends to the person  whose feelings you wish to heal and say something like \u201cwhen I said that you were  wrong and then I insisted that such and such was the only way, well, I am sorry I said that.  I was insensitive and I\u2019m sorry.  Furthermore, I will try to change.\u201d Even if the other person does not immediately forgive you - even if you are mistaken as to whether you apologized about something that in fact hurt the other person\u2019s feelings - you\u2019ll make the other person feel better because the other person will know that you care enough about him or her to say you\u2019re sorry.

The following example demonstrates how this self-reliance is a mistake.I was standing in line recently at the post office.  Each clerk was involved with a customer who clearly had some unusual problem that seemed to require unending attention.  There were three other people ahead of me in line.  Each of the three held boxes that no doubt were going to require lengthy attention once the clerks were freed from their current interminable chores.  I began to feel the familiar heart pounding that I experience when I am forced to wait in line.  I considered my options.  I could leave and try again later to mail my overnight envelope, but that would only result in more travel time and would therefore waste more time than waiting for a clerk now.  I resolved to wait.  I closed my eyes and asked my Higher Power to calm me, but my heart continued to race.  I  noticed a woman standing behind me.  I took a chance and told her, \u201cYou know, my biggest weakness is waiting.  I can actually feel my heart pounding through my chest.\u201d  She replied, \u201cI know what you mean, it\u2019s especially hard when it looks like the wait will never end.\u201dI made eye contact with her and smiled.

We all know people who act like they have the weight of the world constantly upon them every day. We find them at work, at school, in grocery store lines, even while we are stopped at a red light. We also are continually exposed to negative stimuli like newspapers, television, the internet, all of which bombard us daily with all the new ways the world seems to be struggling. Clients, customers, parents and children complain to us. They grumble and use negative words to express their plights. If we let them drive our bus, we can become fearful, anxious, and depressed, and these are states which can lead to relapse.In the face of all of this negativity, an excellent way to  keep a positive attitude and therefore stay sober and serene is to say short positive messages to yourself.Dr. Emile Coue\u2019 was a noted physician in the 1920's. He described how he helped his patients heal themselves from such diseases as rheumatism, tubercular sores, paralysis, fibrous tumors and ulcers by autosuggestion. He is credited with the phrase, \u201cDay by day, in every way, I am getting better and better.\u201d", "identifier": 1106, "todo": "To Do: I\u2019ve found that I can turn around a negative or nervous thought  by repeating the phrase, \u201cI feel physically good.\" See if this phrase works for you, or perhaps you can create your own.

Be assured this was not the fresh, new fallen snow, described in fairy books; rather it was the black snow typically found on the streets of Northeast Ohio after being subjected to day after day of automobile exhaust systems and snow plows. I tried not to feel negative about the black snow.  I repeated (almost chanting) to myself that the snow did not bother me, that in fact the black snow was beautiful because here on God\u2019s earth, everything has beauty. Guess what?  I just became more miserable because I was in denial about how I really felt about the snow. I tried changing my messages.  I told myself that the black snow was ugly.  I  admitted  that I didn\u2019t  like it, but that it was okay the way it was even though it annoyed me and I preferred it to be different. I therefore changed my attitude from denial to acceptance.  I immediately felt much better. Notice that I didn't spend a long time debating why I lived in Northeast Ohio. I didn't compare myself to people who live in Florida. I didn't wish that the snow would magically disappear. I kept it simple. I changed myself. I did not change the situation. And I felt better.The lesson I therefore learned was that I could feel better even while looking at black snow.  However, I first had to be honest enough to admit that I thought the snow was ugly.  \u201cAcceptance is the answer to all my problems today. When I am disturbed, it is because I find some person, place, thing, or situation - some fact of my life - unacceptable to me, and I can find no serenity until I accept that person, place, thing, or situation as being exactly the way it is supposed to be at this moment. Nothing, absolutely nothing happens in God\u2019s world by mistake. Until I could accept my alcoholism, I could not stay sober; unless I accept life completely on life\u2019s terms, I cannot be happy. I need to concentrate not so much on what needs to be changed in the world as on what needs to be changed in me and my attitudes.\u201d page 417 of the Big Book.Acceptance is the foundation for how you can deal successfully and serenely with anyone and anything.

Be assured this was not the fresh, new fallen snow, described in fairy books; rather it was the black snow typically found on the streets of Northeast Ohio after being subjected to day after day of automobile exhaust systems and snow plows. I tried not to feel negative about the black snow.  I repeated (almost chanting) to myself that the snow did not bother me, that in fact the black snow was beautiful because here on God\u2019s earth, everything has beauty. Guess what?  I just became more miserable because I was in denial about how I really felt about the snow. I tried changing my messages.  I told myself that the black snow was ugly.  I  admitted  that I didn\u2019t  like it, but that it was okay the way it was even though it annoyed me and I preferred it to be different. I therefore changed my attitude from denial to acceptance.  I immediately felt much better. Notice that I didn't spend a long time debating why I lived in Northeast Ohio. I didn't compare myself to people who live in Florida. I didn't wish that the snow would magically disappear. I kept it simple. I changed myself. I did not change the situation. And I felt better.The lesson I therefore learned was that I could feel better even while looking at black snow.  However, I first had to be honest enough to admit that I thought the snow was ugly.  \u201cAcceptance is the answer to all my problems today. When I am disturbed, it is because I find some person, place, thing, or situation - some fact of my life - unacceptable to me, and I can find no serenity until I accept that person, place, thing, or situation as being exactly the way it is supposed to be at this moment.

Make a conscious effort to accept life and not resist life because if you resist, problems persist.  Everybody, regardless of wealth and health, has daily problems.  Don\u2019t turn problems into drama.  Don\u2019t turn comedy into tragedy.  An exercise I do now on an almost daily basis is to become aware when I am getting upset because I am not getting my way.  One thing I do is to make believe I am in a movie.  I try to imagine how the audience would be responding to my predicament.  Nine times out of ten, the audience would be laughing. They would not be laughing sadistically, but they would be laughing because my predicament is truly funny.  My predicament is a comedy because most of my predicaments are not permanently harmful to me.  Sure they may cost me some time,  money or ego gratification, but ultimately most of my dramas are truly funny, and I can only see their humor once I am able to put myself in the audience.  Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying.  Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55.  My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not \u201cfor that 20 year old\u201d linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.

I tried not to feel negative about the black snow.  I repeated (almost chanting) to myself that the snow did not bother me, that in fact the black snow was beautiful because here on God\u2019s earth, everything has beauty. Guess what?  I just became more miserable because I was in denial about how I really felt about the snow. I tried changing my messages.  I told myself that the black snow was ugly.  I  admitted  that I didn\u2019t  like it, but that it was okay the way it was even though it annoyed me and I preferred it to be different. I therefore changed my attitude from denial to acceptance.  I immediately felt much better. Notice that I didn't spend a long time debating why I lived in Northeast Ohio. I didn't compare myself to people who live in Florida.

Joe was meeting with an old friend who he hadn\u2019t seen for ten years. As they talked about old times in Joe\u2019s living room, Joe noticed that his old buddy  seemed melancholy, and finally Joe asked what was wrong?  His friend finally admitted that his life had been going downhill for years, that he couldn\u2019t stop drinking, that he was nearly penniless and couldn\u2019t figure out a solution.  Joe\u2019s friend looked so thin, Joe offered to go into the kitchen and make him something to eat. Joe\u2019s friend declined saying he had a big lunch. Half wanting to make conversation and half wanting to make sure he had eaten,  Joe asked his old friend what he had for lunch.  The friend replied \u201cOh the same old thing ... bologna sandwich ... I hate bologna and I\u2019ve had it for lunch every day for the past twenty years.\u201d  Joe replied \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just ask your wife to make you something else?\u201d.  The friend replied \u201cI\u2019m not married.\u201d The point is most of us would prefer to live the same old failures just because we are afraid to change.

If it succeeds, then there, within him, is the beginning of learning.\u201d Soren  Kierkegaard.A client told me the following story which illustrates how fear of change keeps us where we don\u2019t want to be. Joe was meeting with an old friend who he hadn\u2019t seen for ten years. As they talked about old times in Joe\u2019s living room, Joe noticed that his old buddy  seemed melancholy, and finally Joe asked what was wrong?  His friend finally admitted that his life had been going downhill for years, that he couldn\u2019t stop drinking, that he was nearly penniless and couldn\u2019t figure out a solution.  Joe\u2019s friend looked so thin, Joe offered to go into the kitchen and make him something to eat. Joe\u2019s friend declined saying he had a big lunch. Half wanting to make conversation and half wanting to make sure he had eaten,  Joe asked his old friend what he had for lunch.  The friend replied \u201cOh the same old thing ... bologna sandwich ... I hate bologna and I\u2019ve had it for lunch every day for the past twenty years.\u201d  Joe replied \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just ask your wife to make you something else?\u201d.  The friend replied \u201cI\u2019m not married.\u201d The point is most of us would prefer to live the same old failures just because we are afraid to change.

But suffering directs a man to look within. If it succeeds, then there, within him, is the beginning of learning.\u201d Soren  Kierkegaard.A client told me the following story which illustrates how fear of change keeps us where we don\u2019t want to be. Joe was meeting with an old friend who he hadn\u2019t seen for ten years. As they talked about old times in Joe\u2019s living room, Joe noticed that his old buddy  seemed melancholy, and finally Joe asked what was wrong?  His friend finally admitted that his life had been going downhill for years, that he couldn\u2019t stop drinking, that he was nearly penniless and couldn\u2019t figure out a solution.  Joe\u2019s friend looked so thin, Joe offered to go into the kitchen and make him something to eat. Joe\u2019s friend declined saying he had a big lunch. Half wanting to make conversation and half wanting to make sure he had eaten,  Joe asked his old friend what he had for lunch.  The friend replied \u201cOh the same old thing ... bologna sandwich ... I hate bologna and I\u2019ve had it for lunch every day for the past twenty years.\u201d  Joe replied \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just ask your wife to make you something else?\u201d.  The friend replied \u201cI\u2019m not married.\u201d The point is most of us would prefer to live the same old failures just because we are afraid to change.

I tried not to feel negative about the black snow.

However, sometimes we don\u2019t even wait for a response. \u201cHow are you?\u201d has taken the place of \u201cHi.\u201d It may be a good idea to break this little habit because some people may infer that you don\u2019t care about them if you don\u2019t even wait for a response to your inquiry. We make a big deal about this in therapy and for good cause. How one is doing is very important to one\u2019s sobriety. Recovering alcoholics need each other to stay sober, and waiting for a response to the \u201cHow are you?\u201d inquiry is critical.Similarly, recovering people should not respond to a \u201cHow are you?\u201d question with the word \u201cFine.\u201d \u201cFine\u201d is too often merely a cover up for fear of expressing what is commonly deemed socially unacceptable feelings.  The acronym given to FINE is F--ked up, Insane, Neurotic and Excited.    In her classic book, \u201cPeoplemaking,\u201d Virginia Satir states:If a person feels bad and he\u2019s asked how he feels, he will answer, \u201cFine,\u201d because...he probably concludes, no one is really interested anyway, so why not pick the expected answer?\u201d P.51.Now I am not arguing here that we need to make too big a deal of a simple \u201cHow are ya\u2019\u201d in our everyday affairs.

This may make a positive difference in how it affects the other person.Asking \"how are you doing\" (and meaning it) can be applied to anyone with whom you want to improve a relationship. If you find you are constantly telling your son to hang up his clothes, take out the trash, clean the tables, etc. you will be amazed how your teenager will respond when you just ask him \u201cHow Ya Doin\u2019?\u201d  The same is true for your wife of twenty years.

As they talked about old times in Joe\u2019s living room, Joe noticed that his old buddy  seemed melancholy, and finally Joe asked what was wrong?

Although the best reason to stay clean and sober is for oneself, I believe that the addict who stays sober is also motivated by knowing that staying sober will help someone else.   \u201c Keep yourself like an empty vessel for God to fill.  Keep pouring out yourself to help others so that God can keep filling you up with His spirit.  The more you give, the more you will have for yourself.

Love means you never have to say you\u2019re sorry.\u201d  That quote was often repeated by young married couples - as the divorce rate escalated.  The truth is that anyone who uses that quote is doomed to make the other person feel worse.  This is true for two fundamental reasons: first, it assumes that the person refusing to say he or she is sorry is perfect, and we all know that perfect people only exist in the movies.  Second, the above quote encourages partners (and adversaries) to stifle verbal communication and to take the other person\u2019s feelings for granted.  Often relationship breakdown occurs because we expect perfection from others even though we know that we all have subjective points of view and we all make mistakes. These mistakes cause wars, divorce, hurt feelings and negotiation breakdown.  So the first step in trying to understand others is to remember that the other person is imperfect and incapable of behaving in exactly the way that you expect him or her to behave. To improve relationships, search for the point during the relationship where we hurt the other person\u2019s feelings, remembering that we can injure feelings even when we were absolutely justified in what we said or did.  It is important to focus on what we may have done , rather than merely trying to prove the other person wrong. Proving someone wrong makes them feel bad.  The sad truth is the overwhelming majority of people are just not wise and callous enough to accept being proved wrong, and they may hold this bad feeling against you.  Often we do the most damage to a relationship when we believe we are right or when we feel most justified in what we say or do. Righteousness and justification can work hell on interpersonal relationships. Righteousness and justification are frequently the stuff of our real enemy, the ego. When you take your inventory, you may find that righteousness and justification may be causing you resentments and are character defects that you may want to humbly ask your Higher Power to remove.  If this is the case, you may conclude that you need to make amends to the person  whose feelings you wish to heal and say something like \u201cwhen I said that you were  wrong and then I insisted that such and such was the only way, well, I am sorry I said that.  I was insensitive and I\u2019m sorry.  Furthermore, I will try to change.\u201d Even if the other person does not immediately forgive you - even if you are mistaken as to whether you apologized about something that in fact hurt the other person\u2019s feelings - you\u2019ll make the other person feel better because the other person will know that you care enough about him or her to say you\u2019re sorry.

Although the best reason to stay clean and sober is for oneself, I believe that the addict who stays sober is also motivated by knowing that staying sober will help someone else.   \u201c Keep yourself like an empty vessel for God to fill.  Keep pouring out yourself to help others so that God can keep filling you up with His spirit.  The more you give, the more you will have for yourself.

I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.

My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old.  She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.  I wore  them to the gym where I spent hours torturing myself trying to lift weights that were too heavy for me but not \u201cfor that 20 year old\u201d linebacker who always showed up in the gym when I did.  That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out.  I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants.  I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style.  After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower.  I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.  I immediately felt embarrassed.  Then, I mentally shifted into my movie and joined the audience.  You can imagine the laugh I had.  I later told my wife about it, and we laughed together.

I tried not to feel negative about the black snow.  I repeated (almost chanting) to myself that the snow did not bother me, that in fact the black snow was beautiful because here on God\u2019s earth, everything has beauty. Guess what?

I  admitted  that I didn\u2019t  like it, but that it was okay the way it was even though it annoyed me and I preferred it to be different. I therefore changed my attitude from denial to acceptance.  I immediately felt much better. Notice that I didn't spend a long time debating why I lived in Northeast Ohio. I didn't compare myself to people who live in Florida. I didn't wish that the snow would magically disappear. I kept it simple. I changed myself. I did not change the situation.

We make a big deal about this in therapy and for good cause. How one is doing is very important to one\u2019s sobriety. Recovering alcoholics need each other to stay sober, and waiting for a response to the \u201cHow are you?\u201d inquiry is critical.Similarly, recovering people should not respond to a \u201cHow are you?\u201d question with the word \u201cFine.\u201d \u201cFine\u201d is too often merely a cover up for fear of expressing what is commonly deemed socially unacceptable feelings.

In her classic book, \u201cPeoplemaking,\u201d Virginia Satir states:If a person feels bad and he\u2019s asked how he feels, he will answer, \u201cFine,\u201d because...he probably concludes, no one is really interested anyway, so why not pick the expected answer?\u201d P.51.Now I am not arguing here that we need to make too big a deal of a simple \u201cHow are ya\u2019\u201d in our everyday affairs.

We all know people who act like they have the weight of the world constantly upon them every day. We find them at work, at school, in grocery store lines, even while we are stopped at a red light. We also are continually exposed to negative stimuli like newspapers, television, the internet, all of which bombard us daily with all the new ways the world seems to be struggling. Clients, customers, parents and children complain to us. They grumble and use negative words to express their plights. If we let them drive our bus, we can become fearful, anxious, and depressed, and these are states which can lead to relapse.In the face of all of this negativity, an excellent way to  keep a positive attitude and therefore stay sober and serene is to say short positive messages to yourself.Dr. Emile Coue\u2019 was a noted physician in the 1920's.

I consequently tend to stuff too much into one day.  I tend to create artificial deadlines.  I fear that if I don\u2019t get everything done today, it\u2019ll pile up and then I\u2019ll be \u201cunder the gun.\u201d   So, I make the mistake of creating an emergency due to my fear of putting myself under the gun later.  This occurs because I am overly conscious of the negative consequences of procrastination.Solution to problem 2: Regarding my fear that if I don\u2019t do it now, it will never get done is also a bunch of hooey!  If it doesn\u2019t get done today, tomorrow or the next day, then it\u2019s because I either had something more remunerative to be done or I\u2019m dead in which case it won\u2019t matter.

Anytime I use that word, I\u2019ve got to wonder if this is a \u201cboogie man\u201d I\u2019m creating or whether I really have anything to fear.  In recovery, the acronym for fear is False Evidence Appearing Real. Fear is illusory.  I must therefore ask myself, \u201cWhat am I afraid of?\u201d Again, prioritizing is the key to dealing with my fear of not getting everything done.Solution to problem 3: To schedule more time between meetings, I need to take into account human functions like driving time, running into somebody who may need a kind word, or even helping someone who may have a real emergency.

The bigger picture, of course, is we all have a right to move along with our lives and sometimes that means it is my turn to wait. Scheduling \u201cin between time\u201d gives me more time to make others feel better.  I\u2019ve found that if I take a few minutes to \u201cstop and smell\u201d the roses, my mind relaxes.By living in the above simple solutions, I have eased a lot of the emergencies out of my life, and I have continued to be more productive too.  I\u2019m easier on myself, and I achieve my goal more often because I\u2019m easier on others.

We all know people who act like they have the weight of the world constantly upon them every day. We find them at work, at school, in grocery store lines, even while we are stopped at a red light. We also are continually exposed to negative stimuli like newspapers, television, the internet, all of which bombard us daily with all the new ways the world seems to be struggling. Clients, customers, parents and children complain to us. They grumble and use negative words to express their plights. If we let them drive our bus, we can become fearful, anxious, and depressed, and these are states which can lead to relapse.In the face of all of this negativity, an excellent way to  keep a positive attitude and therefore stay sober and serene is to say short positive messages to yourself.Dr. Emile Coue\u2019 was a noted physician in the 1920's. He described how he helped his patients heal themselves from such diseases as rheumatism, tubercular sores, paralysis, fibrous tumors and ulcers by autosuggestion.

Be assured this was not the fresh, new fallen snow, described in fairy books; rather it was the black snow typically found on the streets of Northeast Ohio after being subjected to day after day of automobile exhaust systems and snow plows. I tried not to feel negative about the black snow.  I repeated (almost chanting) to myself that the snow did not bother me, that in fact the black snow was beautiful because here on God\u2019s earth, everything has beauty. Guess what?  I just became more miserable because I was in denial about how I really felt about the snow. I tried changing my messages.  I told myself that the black snow was ugly.  I  admitted  that I didn\u2019t  like it, but that it was okay the way it was even though it annoyed me and I preferred it to be different. I therefore changed my attitude from denial to acceptance.  I immediately felt much better. Notice that I didn't spend a long time debating why I lived in Northeast Ohio. I didn't compare myself to people who live in Florida. I didn't wish that the snow would magically disappear. I kept it simple. I changed myself. I did not change the situation. And I felt better.The lesson I therefore learned was that I could feel better even while looking at black snow.  However, I first had to be honest enough to admit that I thought the snow was ugly.  \u201cAcceptance is the answer to all my problems today. When I am disturbed, it is because I find some person, place, thing, or situation - some fact of my life - unacceptable to me, and I can find no serenity until I accept that person, place, thing, or situation as being exactly the way it is supposed to be at this moment. Nothing, absolutely nothing happens in God\u2019s world by mistake. Until I could accept my alcoholism, I could not stay sober; unless I accept life completely on life\u2019s terms, I cannot be happy.

The beginning of understanding may actually involve your apology and willingness to make amends. There was a hit movie in the 1970's starring Ryan O\u2019Neil and Allie McGraw, that many deem a classic, called \u201cLove Story.\u201d   It was a romance between a poor girl and a rich boy.  At one point, the poor girl says, \u201cDon\u2019t you know Ollie,...  Love means you never have to say you\u2019re sorry.\u201d  That quote was often repeated by young married couples - as the divorce rate escalated.  The truth is that anyone who uses that quote is doomed to make the other person feel worse.  This is true for two fundamental reasons: first, it assumes that the person refusing to say he or she is sorry is perfect, and we all know that perfect people only exist in the movies.  Second, the above quote encourages partners (and adversaries) to stifle verbal communication and to take the other person\u2019s feelings for granted.  Often relationship breakdown occurs because we expect perfection from others even though we know that we all have subjective points of view and we all make mistakes. These mistakes cause wars, divorce, hurt feelings and negotiation breakdown.  So the first step in trying to understand others is to remember that the other person is imperfect and incapable of behaving in exactly the way that you expect him or her to behave. To improve relationships, search for the point during the relationship where we hurt the other person\u2019s feelings, remembering that we can injure feelings even when we were absolutely justified in what we said or did.  It is important to focus on what we may have done , rather than merely trying to prove the other person wrong. Proving someone wrong makes them feel bad.  The sad truth is the overwhelming majority of people are just not wise and callous enough to accept being proved wrong, and they may hold this bad feeling against you.  Often we do the most damage to a relationship when we believe we are right or when we feel most justified in what we say or do. Righteousness and justification can work hell on interpersonal relationships. Righteousness and justification are frequently the stuff of our real enemy, the ego. When you take your inventory, you may find that righteousness and justification may be causing you resentments and are character defects that you may want to humbly ask your Higher Power to remove.  If this is the case, you may conclude that you need to make amends to the person  whose feelings you wish to heal and say something like \u201cwhen I said that you were  wrong and then I insisted that such and such was the only way, well, I am sorry I said that.  I was insensitive and I\u2019m sorry.  Furthermore, I will try to change.\u201d Even if the other person does not immediately forgive you - even if you are mistaken as to whether you apologized about something that in fact hurt the other person\u2019s feelings - you\u2019ll make the other person feel better because the other person will know that you care enough about him or her to say you\u2019re sorry.

But suffering directs a man to look within. If it succeeds, then there, within him, is the beginning of learning.\u201d Soren  Kierkegaard.A client told me the following story which illustrates how fear of change keeps us where we don\u2019t want to be. Joe was meeting with an old friend who he hadn\u2019t seen for ten years. As they talked about old times in Joe\u2019s living room, Joe noticed that his old buddy  seemed melancholy, and finally Joe asked what was wrong?  His friend finally admitted that his life had been going downhill for years, that he couldn\u2019t stop drinking, that he was nearly penniless and couldn\u2019t figure out a solution.  Joe\u2019s friend looked so thin, Joe offered to go into the kitchen and make him something to eat. Joe\u2019s friend declined saying he had a big lunch. Half wanting to make conversation and half wanting to make sure he had eaten,  Joe asked his old friend what he had for lunch.  The friend replied \u201cOh the same old thing ... bologna sandwich ... I hate bologna and I\u2019ve had it for lunch every day for the past twenty years.\u201d  Joe replied \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just ask your wife to make you something else?\u201d.  The friend replied \u201cI\u2019m not married.\u201d The point is most of us would prefer to live the same old failures just because we are afraid to change.
