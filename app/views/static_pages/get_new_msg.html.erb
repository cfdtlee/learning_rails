The lowest rung is called happy memories . \"Happy memories\" means that you are thinking about the good times you had while you were using. The next rung up is called \"I wasn't that bad .\" This occurs when you tell yourself you weren't really that bad, that your addiction was someone else's fault, that your problem was caused by anything except your disease. The next rung higher is stopping treatment.  This means that you cease going to meetings, you stop practicing the steps, you don't have time to see your therapist, you stop talking to your sponsor, you don't do your daily meditation. When you stop treatment, you pretend that you can stay sober by doing nothing. The fourth rung is called high risk situations . Examples are you return to the bar that you used to frequent, you begin hanging out with your old using friends, you spend long periods of time isolating in the basement where you used to drink vodka. You put yourself in these situations not thinking that you will use there, but just to experience the feeling of being there again. The fifth rung is called,  emotional imbalance . During emotional imbalance, something causes you to get really angry, irritated or otherwise emotional and you remember how your drug, drink or behavior took away the pain of the emotion. You may even get really happy and you remember how you always drank to celebrate.  Now you are really getting higher on the ladder, and like any ladder, the higher you go, the more dangerous the climb. Also, the higher you go, the more committed you are to reaching the top.  The sixth rung is fantasizing.  Now, you are spending increasing periods of your day thinking about using for no apparent reason. Fantasizing leads to the seventh rung,  getting ready to use . This means you intend to use and you plan how you are going to relapse. You tell yourself that tonight when my husband is asleep, I am going to sneak out to the Bar. You make arrangements to buy drugs. You return to the internet porn site. You get dressed to go to the casino. You think through the exact steps of where you are going to go to get your drugs, drink, or act out. On the next rung, you actually get the drugs or order the drink. You acquire the tools of relapse. On this rung, you may feel a terrible panic, and unless you reach out to someone (which is now incredibly difficult to do because you are so committed to reaching the top), you step up to the final and ninth rung which is Relapse .   As you know, the Relapse rung has a crack in it and cannot bear your weight. So you come crashing down. Sometimes the crash happens immediately. Sometimes, the crack worsens over time. But since there is a crack, you will fall. If you survive the fall, you will feel guilt at having relapsed. You will resolve to stop using.

There is you and there is your disease. If you tell someone that you may be on the Relapse Ladder, you are telling on your disease, not you. So, ask yourself if you are on any of the nine rungs. If so, say to yourself, \"I must get off the ladder now\" five times to yourself with increasing emphasis. Then pick up the phone and tell your trusted friend, confidant, therapist, or mentor which rung of the ladder you are on and that you want to get off. (Leaving a voicemail message also works). If you can’t connect with someone, read your recovery literature, pray to your Higher Power, write down which rung you are on and list the consequences which made you want to get sober in the first place. Do something recovery oriented and don't substitute your drug of choice with another drug or bad behavior lest you start a new addiction. Then try to connect with a supportive person as soon as possible. This process works regardless of your philosophical or religious beliefs. Remember, sharing with another doesn’t mean that you only reach out when you have a recognizable craving or urge to use. Sharing means that you reach out and discuss where you may be on the Relapse Ladder."

I am allowed to feel sad or angry for a few seconds even if I only lost something as replaceable as my car keys or as meaningless as a chess game. I even remind myself that I do not always know whether something I really wanted in the short term is what is really best for me in the long term. For example, when I graduated from law school, I wanted nothing more than to be hired by a prestigious law firm. I spent nights dreaming of the money, benefits and glory of being associated with a renowned firm. But of the seven or eight firms I applied to, not one of them extended an offer.

A client told me the following story which illustrates how fear of change keeps us where we don't want to be. Joe was meeting with an old friend whom he hadn't seen for ten years. As they talked about old times in Joe's living room, Joe noticed that his old buddy seemed melancholy, and finally Joe asked what was wrong? His friend finally admitted that his life had been going downhill for years, that he couldn't stop drinking, that he was nearly penniless and couldn't figure out a solution. Joe's friend looked so thin, Joe offered to go into the kitchen and make him something to eat. Joe's friend declined saying he had a big lunch.

I hate bologna and I've had it for lunch every day for the past twenty years.\" Joe replied, \"Why don't you just ask your wife to make you something else?\" The friend replied \"I'm not married.\" The point is most of us would prefer to live the same old failures just because we are afraid to change.

There were three other people ahead of me in line. Each of the three held boxes that no doubt were going to require lengthy attention once the clerks were freed from their current interminable chores. I began to feel the familiar heart pounding that I experience when I am forced to wait in line. I considered my options. I could leave and try again later to mail my overnight envelope, but that would only result in more travel time and would therefore waste more time than waiting for a clerk now. I resolved to wait. I closed my eyes and asked my Higher Power to calm me, but my heart continued to race. I noticed a woman standing behind me. I took a chance and told her, \"You know, my biggest weakness is waiting. I can actually feel my heart pounding through my chest.\" She replied, \"I know what you mean, it's especially hard when it looks like the wait will never end.\" I made eye contact with her and smiled.

    "content": "How Are You\" and Not Wait for the Answer.\" It is of course commonplace to say \"How are you?\" when we run into an acquaintance on the street or as we begin a telephone call. However, sometimes we don't even wait for a response. \"How are you?\" has taken the place of \"Hi.\" It may be a good idea to break this little habit because some people may infer that you don't care about them if you don't even wait for a response to your inquiry. We make a big deal about this in therapy and for good cause. How one is doing is very important to one's sobriety. Recovering alcoholics need each other to stay sober, and waiting for a response to the \"How are you?\" inquiry is critical. Similarly, recovering people should not respond to a \"How are you?\" question with the word \"Fine.\" \"Fine\" is too often merely a cover up for fear of expressing what is commonly deemed socially unacceptable feelings. The acronym given to FINE is F--ked up, Insane, Neurotic and Excited. In her classic book, \"Peoplemaking,\" Virginia Satir says: If a person feels bad and he's asked how he feels, he will answer, \"Fine,\" because...he probably concludes, no one is really interested anyway, so why not pick the expected answer?\" P.51. Now I am not arguing that we need to make too big a deal of a simple \"How are ya'\" in our everyday affairs. However, at least wait a second for a response to your \"How are ya'?\" At least say it and try to care. This may make a positive difference in how it affects the other person. Asking \"how are you doing\" (and meaning it) can be applied to anyone with whom you want to improve a relationship. If you find you are constantly telling your son to hang up his clothes, take out the trash, clean the tables, etc. you will be amazed how your teenager will respond when you just ask him \"How Ya Doin'?\" The same is true for your wife of twenty years. Spouses seem to spend so much of their daily conversations solving problems. Perhaps just asking your spouse \"How ya Doin?\" without expecting any specific response will show your love. This is a great way to make a \"living amends.\"",

    "quote" : "\"Remember Love Means Saying You're Sorry\"",
    "content": "When you are trying to understand rather than be understood, you are pushing yourself further away from a relapse. The beginning of understanding may actually involve your apology and willingness to make amends. There was a hit movie in the 1970's starring Ryan O'Neil and Allie McGraw, that many deem a classic, called \"Love Story.\" It was a romance between a poor girl and a rich boy. At one point, the poor girl says, \"Don't you know Ollie,... Love means you never have to say you're sorry.\" That quote was often repeated by young married couples - as the divorce rate escalated. The truth is that anyone who uses that quote is doomed to make the other person feel worse. This is true for two fundamental reasons: first, it assumes that the person refusing to say he or she is sorry is perfect, and we all know that perfect people only exist in the movies. Second, the above quote encourages partners (and adversaries) to stifle verbal communication and to take the other person's feelings for granted. Often relationship breakdown occurs because we expect perfection from others even though we know that we all have subjective points of view and we all make mistakes. These mistakes cause wars, divorce, hurt feelings and negotiation breakdown. So the first step in trying to understand others is to remember that the other person is imperfect and incapable of behaving in exactly the way that you expect him or her to behave. To improve relationships, search for the point during the relationship where you hurt the other person's feelings, remembering that we can injure feelings even when we were absolutely justified in what we said or did. It is important to focus on what we may have done, rather than merely trying to prove the other person wrong. Proving someone wrong makes them feel bad. The sad truth is the overwhelming majority of people are just not wise and callous enough to accept being proved wrong, and they may hold this bad feeling against you. Often we do the most damage to a relationship when we believe we are right or when we feel most justified in what we say or do. Righteousness and justification can work hell on interpersonal relationships. Righteousness and justification are frequently the stuff of our real enemy, the ego. When you take your inventory, you may find that righteousness and justification may be causing you resentments and are character defects that you may want to humbly ask your Higher Power to remove. If this is the case, you may conclude that you need to make amends to the person whose feelings you wish to heal and say something like \"when I said that you were wrong and then I insisted that such and such was the only way, well, I am sorry I said that. I was insensitive and I'm sorry. Furthermore, I will try to change.\" Even if the other person does not immediately forgive you - even if you are mistaken as to whether you apologized about something that in fact hurt the other person's feelings - you'll make the other person feel better because the other person will know that you care enough about him or her to say you're sorry.",

I consequently tend to stuff too much into one day. I tend to create artificial deadlines. I fear that if I don't get everything done today, it'll pile up and then I'll be \"under the gun.\" So, I make the mistake of creating an emergency due to my fear of putting myself under the gun later. This occurs because I am overly conscious of the negative consequences of procrastination. Ironically, I have many clients who always procrastinate because they feel like there are so many things that must get done that they become afraid to start doing any of them. They feel so many overwhelming emergencies, they just don't know where to start. So they become paralyzed and procrastinate.",
    "category_id": null,
    "todo": "Solution to problem 1: Feeling I have to get everything done that I have listed on my calendar just plain isn’t true.  When I have this attitude, I am falling victim to the impossible desire for my life to be complete with nothing left to do. The truth is that my life is a constantly evolving journey that is certainly never wound up in a neat little ball and complete.  So, I just have to try to better prioritize and do less.  If I can’t get something done, I go to the next day in the calendar and mark it “Do what’s left from yesterday.” Solution to problem 2: Regarding my fear that if I don’t do it now, it will never get done is also a bunch of hooey!  If it doesn’t get done today, tomorrow or the next day, then it’s because I either had something more remunerative to be done or I’m dead in which case it won’t matter.  I must also note that I used the word “FEAR” in stating my problem.  Anytime I use that word, I’ve got to wonder if this is a “boogie man” I’m creating or whether I really have anything to fear.  In recovery, the acronym for fear is False Evidence Appearing Real. Fear is illusory.  I must therefore ask myself, “What am I afraid of?” Again, prioritizing is the key to dealing with my fear of not getting everything done. Solution to problem 3: To schedule more time between meetings, I need to take into account human functions like driving time, running into somebody who may need a kind word, or even helping someone who may have a real emergency. I’ve got to remember that red lights happen too.  They weren’t just put there to make me angry and impede my way.  Everybody has to stop for them.  The bigger picture, of course, is we all have a right to move along with our lives and sometimes that means it is my turn to wait. Scheduling “in between time” gives me more time to make others feel better.  I’ve found that if I take a few minutes to “stop and smell” the roses, my mind relaxes. By living in the above simple solutions, I have eased a lot of the emergencies out of my life, and I have continued to be more productive too.  I’m easier on myself, and I achieve my goal more often because I’m easier on others. Once you have analyzed the ways you mismanage time and jotted down a few simple solutions, you will be amazed at how you will have more time and how stress, fear, and anxiety will melt away."

    "title": "Lower Your Expectations",
    "quote" : "\"Lower Your Expectations\"",
    "content": "One way to ruin our serenity and head for a relapse is to have too high expectations of ourselves and others. High expectations cause stress. Such stress may actually cause us to perform worse. It is far better to have lower expectations to minimize stress and disappointment. We can then be pleasantly surprised when we perform well. Lowering one's expectations does not require lowering one's optimism. We should always be encouraging and hopeful that we and others will try their best; we should always approach challenges with confidence. However, we must also bear in mind that none of us are perfect, and that intended results are never guaranteed. By lowering our expectations, we become less dependent on others (and external circumstances beyond our control) controlling our serenity. A perfect example is my use of the telephone.  Let's say I'm calling a client, and I have high expectations that the call will go smoothly such that I'll accomplish exactly what I set out to do.   First, I expect to find the telephone number easily in my smart phone calendar. I scroll through it and can't find it.  I am shocked, disappointed.  \"How on earth (actually I'd probably say something much worse) can that guy's number not be in my doggone (trust me, I'd say something far worse) smart phone.\" I'd worry that my entire office system was askew if I couldn't keep organized enough to find a simple, stupid telephone number.   I'd then do what I usually do in such instances - flip through my paper file where I probably scribbled the client's number.  As I flip through each page, I would feel more and more irritated and even hostile.  \"What an idiot I am.  What a waste of time.  If I had only done what any simple minded idiot could have done and taken a second ... and...\" the negative messages (self-flagellation) might go on until I was actually questioning whether I was so stupid that I shouldn't even be a counselor, that I probably should just close down my office and \"What is the meaning of life any way if God himself should so punish me that I can't find this stupid phone number.\" By the time I find the phone number, I am so angry I'll probably be unable to deal positively with the client anyway. Now, let's take the same scenario with lower expectations. Once again, the phone number isn't in the rolodex. But this time, I didn't expect it to be in the first place I looked for it. Rather, I started looking for the number knowing that I had been in a hurry on Friday afternoon to go home and see my son play baseball and that I had scribbled it somewhere close by and that if I took a minute and patiently looked for it now everything would be just fine and dandy. I tell myself I am as imperfect as anyone else so why not give myself a break. By the time I find the number, I'm still serene (or as serene as can be expected on a Monday morning) and I call the client with a positive attitude. In this case, I lowered my expectations to make myself feel better so that I could be in a good frame of mind when trying to counsel a client.  Another way to have lower expectations (and therefore higher serenity) is to make plans, not results.   If we make plans and don't expect results, we have a better chance to avoid frustration because whenever we try to do something, we can't be sure it will turn out exactly the way we envisioned it.   More often than not, some strange twist occurs which \"lays to rest our best laid plans.\" Accordingly, we should never set out to do anything hell bent on getting certain, exact results or else we will likely be frustrated.   It is wiser and infinitely more comforting to be flexible and content if our plans seem to be headed in the right direction.   Furthermore, with a little faith, we will usually get results which are better than anything we had envisioned if our plans are guided by love, honesty, unselfishness and a pure, not jealous heart.

I try to imagine how the audience would be responding to my predicament. Nine times out of ten, the audience would be laughing. They would not be laughing sadistically, but they would be laughing because my predicament is truly funny. My predicament is a comedy because most of my predicaments are not permanently harmful to me. Sure they may cost me some time, money or ego gratification, but ultimately most of my dramas are truly funny, and I can only see their humor once I am able to put myself in the audience. Now I frequently end up laughing rather than crying. Seeing the comedy makes me a lighter, happier person. I recently turned 55. I had a real problem with 55. My wife knew I had been working out harder than ever in an effort to resist what I perceived as getting old. She bought me a new pair of exercise pants.

That day, two sexy 20 year old female personal trainers were also working out. I thought I looked pretty good in my new exercise pants. I kind of strutted around during my workout, spending a lot of time walking in front of the gals, proud of my new young looking, stylish exercise pants. I may be 55, I thought, but I still can dress in style. After my workout, I went into the locker room and took my pants off to take a shower. I noticed I had forgotten to remove the store tags which were sticking about three inches out of the rear pocket on that plastic string that makes the tags not only clearly noticeable but reminiscent of a huge flag.

Later, it may help improve relationships to let others explain to you how you can make amends to them. The best way to discover how is to humbly ask what is wrong. If you are fortunate enough to get an honest answer, don't argue. Another's feelings of being wronged do not need to make sense. Feelings rarely make sense. Don't expect to understand or agree with the other person. Don't try to explain why you felt you were right at the time the other person felt wronged by you. Simply say \"thank you for telling me.\" Remember the goal is to mend the relationship, (and the first step is to get the other person to express his or her feelings) not to be right or justified. Let's assume you have a problem with your wife. After she tells you what you have done wrong and you have reinforced her for opening up, tell her that you are going to think carefully about what she said and see what you can do to change that wrong. Since most things that happened in the past cannot be changed, you may have to tell her that you are now going to amend your behavior as best as you can so that it never happens again. You may think that what she perceives as wrong is something you both need a counselor to assist you in resolving. At the very least, you now have something you can deal with because you have enabled the other person to let you know what you need to deal with to change the relationship. Without such knowledge, no progress can be made. You'll find that a reduction of your ego with a commensurate improvement in your attitude level is the key to finding out where you went wrong in a relationship.

(2)  Contemplation means that you believe you may have a problem and are willing to consider change but you are struggling with ambivalence and weighing the pros and cons and barriers to change.  (3) Preparation involves getting ready to change. (4)  Action means that you are making changes and living new behaviors. (5)  Maintenance means that you are maintaining the behavior changes (and continuing to get rid of nagging character defects) that are a result of your treatment regimen.              Your mission in recovery is to get to maintenance !!               How do you get to maintenance?              REPULSION : You move from precontemplation to contemplation by becoming repulsed by the consequences of addiction and/or mental illness. You see how your illness has been out of control and how it has interfered with your life and other lives.              ABILITY : You move from contemplation to preparation by seeing that you should and can actually change. For example, you see that other people can do it so why can't you. You accept the fact that you can set certain treatment requirements into your schedule. You listen to people who refuse to enable you.              IMPLEMENTATION : You move from preparation to action when you implement treatment techniques. At first, you may still be \"bringing the body\" without being mentally, emotionally or spiritually involved, but at least you are doing something. Gradually (or suddenly), your personality and behavior change such that you are turning into a sober and/or sane person. You implement by doing what people who refuse to enable you suggest. You \"put your toe in the water\" and feel how nice and warm the water is.              CONSISTENCY : Maintenance is then the stage where you keep doing it . You realize that you are never cured so you consistently practice treatment regimens in order to maintain your change, sobriety, and sanity. Consistency is the result of repitition, belief and positive reinforcement.

Yet, we have such a difficult time breaking free from the (1) the insane coping skills we have learned from dealing with insane childhood situations and (2) the prejudices that our parents have instilled in us.             A computer analogy may help.

Rather, it is to rid ourselves of our own long-standing character defects that interfere with our lives.             The first problem is that we have developed coping skills which may have worked in our dysfunctional family but do not work in the real world. For example, drinking alcohol may have worked with regard to our dysfunctional family, but it is causing us trouble in the real world. A more subtle example is the jokester.  Perhaps jokes may have worked as a coping skill to reduce family stress, but making jokes at work may be causing the jokester problems. Another example is the family hero who took control of all of the family responsibilities to cope with parents irresponsibility or sickness. This same hero's over controlling attitude may be causing him problems in the real world. Yet another example may be the child who ran and hid as family tension mounted. This behavior may be causing this person to withdraw and miss out on life.             The second problem is that we may have developed prejudices that our parents have instilled in us.
